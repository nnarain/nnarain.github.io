Well it's been a year... Yes quite the year.

I entered this year fairly optimistic, with grand plans and a visions of what I'd get done and accomplish.. and we'll none of that happened. Admittedly that is kind of the norm, but this year was particularly... interesting.

For reasons I shall not get into, this year was pretty horrible from a personal projects or tech perspective. It has been quite the draining year without much time or motivation for doing technical things. Pretty much anything I had in mind to work on grinded to a halt. It didn't help that I broke my foot this year as well.

At the start of the year, I began [prototyping]({% post_url 2025-01-26-RP2040 Devboard %}) what I'd like to be a Raspberry Pi CM 5 carrier board, with a RP2040 coprocessor.
I have a HAT prototype, but it had some issues.

Other then that I've been working on my homelab. Kubernetes is a bit more complicated then I thought, so I'm stilling ramping things up. I'll be doing more posts on that in the future.

Also thanks, to some coworkers I've been inspired to get back into some 3d printing projects. So I feel things are on an up swing.


Outside of technical work, things have been better. I visted Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia! I also spent times in the Bad Lands!

Outside of travelling, one of the highlights of my year was getting my blue belt in brazilian jiu-jitsu!

As for 2026... well I think I'll just see how things go. I do have some renewed motivation, so I'm hoping I can ride on that for a little while.
