This is a small retrospective post on projects for the last year. I'm also cheating a little bit here as a my goal was to do one post per month.. and I needed one for December (I did do some cookie cutters this month, but I'll post that in the `Makes` section).

**Projects that went well**

I made some pretty good progress on my [light controllers]({% post_url 2022-05-19-ESP32 Light Controller %}). I consider the hardware to be more or less done and I actually have a Rev E design with minor improvements ready to be tested! I'm also working on improved diffusers for my [LED panels]({% post_url 2022-05-14-Assembled LED panels %}). I'm going to do a desk revamp next year and will include the panels for some fancy RGB lighting.


I made a pretty awesome looking [sword]({% post_url 2022-08-31-BotW - Royal Broadsword v2 %})

I also got a chance to writing some Rust code for tooling and as well as my flight controller.. Leading me into...

**Projects that could have been better**

While I'm happy with the prototyping and designs I did for the [icarus flight controller]({% post_url 2022-07-16-Icarus Rev C %}), I didn't make much tanigle progress. There was a lot of back and forth in the scope.

With regards to 3D printing projects, well... a lot of time was wasted on [silly issues]({% post_url 2022-02-26-Curious Case of Y Axis Layer Shift %}). I didn't get to make as many things as I would have liked.

**Awesome Experiences**

I got to [visit Japan and attend ROSCon and IROS]({% post_url 2022-10-31-ROSCon and IROS 2022! %}).

That was definitvely the highlight of the year and one of the best experiences of my life.

So no complaints there.

**Next Year**

* Icarus. I really want to get *something* mounted to an airframe and controlling motors.
* More makes (Which is why I added the new `Makes` section).
* I want to do more electro-machanical builds. Any combination of 3D printing and DIY electronics.
* More robotics. Specifically using ROS2.
