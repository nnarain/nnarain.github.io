Here's a recording of GameboyCore running inside of an Android emulator. It's running surprising fast..

The GameboyCore library is included in the Android Studio build directly with Git submodules.

A `JNI` wrapper is was then made around the `GameboyCore` class along with the necessary native functions.

There is currently no method of input so a gamepad overlay is what needs to be added next.
