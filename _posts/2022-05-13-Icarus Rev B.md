Forgot to make a post about the Rev B of Icarus (I did this a few months ago). This is primarily about reducing the size of the PCB and fixing some mistakes in the Rev A board.

Changes:

* Fixed USB component selection
* Selected smaller push buttons
* Selected a smaller package for 3.3V regulator
* Created a Icarus shield footprint that can be layout with other boards
* The SWD header is removed and pads we added to the underside of the board
* Added a barometer
