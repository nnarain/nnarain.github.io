Screen Timing
-------------

* 60 Hz frame rate - 16.6 ms period
* V-Blank lasts 1.09 ms


LCDC Control Register
---------------------

![Image not found!](/assets/2016/09/09/lcdc-register.png)

LCDC control register.

Configures how object data is read and where it is read from.

STAT Register
-------------

LCD controller status and interrupt configuration.

![Image not found!](/assets/2016/09/09/stat-register.png)

Indicates current status of LCD controller module in the CPU.

* Mode Flag (Bits 1:0) is the current LCDC mode.
* Mode selection (Bits 6:3) Configure what interrupts the LCD controller will produce.

**LCD controller interrupts**

|  Bit  |  Name                    |
| :---: | :----------------------: |
| 6     | LYC = LY Interrupt       |
| 5     | Mode 2 OAM Interrupt     |
| 4     | Mode 1 V-Blank Interrupt |
| 3     | Mode 0 H-Blank Interrupt |

Mode 0

* Horizontal blanking period
* CPU has access to display RAM `$8000 - $9FFF`

Mode 1

* Vertical blanking period
* For approximately 1 ms CPU has access to display RAM `$8000 - $9FFF`

Mode 2:

* Searching OAM and display RAM period
* OAM `$FE00 - $FE90` is being access by the LCD controller and is *not* accessible to the CPU

Mode 3:

* Transferring data to LCD driver period
* LCD controller is using both OAM `$FE00 - $FE90` and display RAM `$8000 - $9FFF` and can *not* be accessed by the CPU

**LCDC Mode Timing Diagram**

Mode 0 is present between 201-207 clks, 2 about 77-83 clks, and 3 about 169-175 clks. A complete cycle through these states takes 456 clks. VBlank lasts 4560 clks. A complete screen refresh occurs every 70224 clks.)

LCDC Y-Coordinate Registers
---------------------------

![Image not found!](/assets/2016/09/09/ly-register.png)

`LY` indicate which line of data is being transferred to the LCD display driver.

* Takes values 0 - 153
* 144 - 153 is the Vertical blanking period

When the `LCDC` goes from ON to OFF, `LY` is reset to 0.

![Image not found!](/assets/2016/09/09/lyc-register.png)

`LYC` is used to compare a value to the `LY` register. If they match the match flag is set in the `STAT` register.

This can be used to invoke an interrupt when `LY` reaches a particular scan line.


Blanking Periods
----------------

![Image not found!](/assets/2016/09/09/blanking.png)

LCD driver scans across each line segment to display memory on the screen. The H-Blank period is the time it takes to re-position to the start of the next scan line. The V-Blank period is the time it takes the LCD driver to re-position to the first line.
