This is the finished design of my semester 4 project in college.

The task is to design and build a board to control DC motors, servos, stepper motors, and read motor encoders all to drive a robot (that will be next semester's project)

Here's the PCB layout:

Pretty neat, eh?

What this board includes:

* Accelerometer
* DC motor driver
* Stepper motor driver
* Servo driver
* Input for motor encoders
* Serial Communication interface via RS-232 (and can be manually swapped to a bluetooth module)
* LCD Display

The board will be powered by a 12V supply and has 5VD, 5VA and 3.3VD supplies built in

The next step is to get the board manufactured and populated with components!
