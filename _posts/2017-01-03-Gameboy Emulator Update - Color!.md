After taking a little break for the holidays decided to start working on color support for my Gameboy Emulator library.

Here's a look at color support for sprites:

Exciting stuff!

In other news. I've being working on the [Python bindings for GameboyCore](https://github.com/nnarain/gameboycore-python).

The main thing I want to do with the python bindings is write scripts that can play Gameboy games!
