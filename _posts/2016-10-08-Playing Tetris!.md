Update on my Gameboy Emulator!!

Implemented Joypad emulation and made some bug fixes to my CPU instruction implementation. Write tests!!!!!

Below is the current progress.

Notice the blocks are the same. This is a bug. Initial thoughts on this are that its the way the Tetris program reads the divider register to generate random numbers.


Edit:

Yup. I had a bug incrementing the divider register!

Score is still in hex though!
