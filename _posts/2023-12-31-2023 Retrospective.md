This is an extra small retrospective on the past year. What was good, what was bad and what I want to do in the coming year.

**The Bad**

More or less summed up in my [last blog post]({% post_url 2023-11-28-The Burnout Post %}). But I think that was a lessoned learned and can be applied to the next year.

**The Good**

Better understanding of what needs to be done for Icarus. I'll probably move to an F4 design and move the RC comms to a separate PCB.

A new Neptune 3 Pro 3D printer to replace my Ender 3 Pro which was causing me a lot of headaches. I also got myself a resin printer so I'm looking forward to trying out some high detail prints.

**Next Year**

I mainly want to work on Icarus as that is a project several years in the making. I want something that can fly. And more large 3D printer projects.
