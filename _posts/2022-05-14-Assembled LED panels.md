Finally got around to assembling my [custom LED panels]({% post_url 2022-03-12-Configurable LED panels %}).

Frames are joined using two screws:

Nothing fancy just hot glue the LED matrices to the frame:

Three frames connected:

Panels on + LED pattern:

**Future work**

There are a few problems with this setup:

* I placed the pads for the LED matrices on the bottom, meaning boards don't sit flush with the frame
* Soldering wires directly to the pads works but it will make rearranging the panels in the future difficult / tedious

The above issues can be improved by adding connectors to each panel.
