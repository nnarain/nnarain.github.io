**What is a genetic algorithm**

A genetic algorithm mimics evolution. The idea is that a possible solution to a problem
is encoded in a 'chromosome' and the genetic algorithm evolves the chromosome, using mating and mutation, towards a solution.

A much better and detailed explanation [here](http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html).

Python implementation to the problem [here](http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat3.html) is below.
