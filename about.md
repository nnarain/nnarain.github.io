About
=====

My name is Natesh. I just recently started working as full time Software Developer. I enjoy programming and working on small projects in my spare time. 

I use this blog as a place to write about the projects I've worked on, just because it's fun to take a look back! Mostly I write small summaries on project milestones, problems I've solved, things like that. 

I would like to, at some point in the future, be able to write those posts you find on the internet that make you think "Hey that was useful". 

Feel free to have a look around :)
