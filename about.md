About
=====

Hi!

My name is Natesh. I'm a software developer currently with in the material transport space, writing sofware for autonomous mobile robots.

I primarily use this blog as a place to talk about the projects that I am working on. Most posts are project updates where I try to elaborate on problems I solved or interesting solutions I came up with.

I'm interested in a wide range of subjects in software development from web development to embedded software. I also dabble in digital electronics and want to get into 3D printing someday.
