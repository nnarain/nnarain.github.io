About
=====

Hi!

My name is Natesh. I'm a software developer currently writing code for autonomous robots.

I primarily use this blog as a place to talk about the projects that I am working on. Most posts are project updates where I try to elaborate on problems I solved or interesting solutions I came up with.

I'm personally interested in writing system software or firmware, as well as desiging digital electronics.
