Hi! 

My name is Natesh, I'm currently studying Electronic Systems Engineering in college, and in my spare time I like to code!

My first taste of programming was back in highschool, with good old Turing, and I just found it awesome!
The fact that all you have to do to display graphics or driver a paraller port is just type some words and hit compile just blows me away.

From then on I wanted to learn as much about programming as possible.

I've learned Java, C, C++, python, dabbled in web dev, opengl and embedded systems. There's so many interesting things to learn!!


So what will this blog be about?

Honestly I have no idea!

I was thinking about using it as a place to post code snippets and how-to, for future reference. Maybe tutorials?
Anything I find useful.

* OpenGL techniques?
* Assembler on HCS12?
* Arduino?
* Android Dev?
* Electronics projects?
* How to use this blogging system?

Depends on what I'm working on!
