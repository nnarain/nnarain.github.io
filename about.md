# About

Hi!

My name is Natesh. I'm a Senior Software Developer specializing in autonomous robotics systems at OTTO by Rockwell Automation. I work on the vehicle platform, developing software for robotic systems that operate in industrial environments.

## What I Do

I have expertise in:
- **System software and firmware development** for embedded systems
- **Robotics software** using ROS and ROS 2
- **Embedded systems programming** with ARM processors, FreeRTOS, and bare-metal firmware
- **Digital electronics design** using tools like KiCad
- **Industrial automation** including PLC gateway systems and factory communication protocols

I'm passionate about building robust, low-level software and designing hardware solutions for complex technical challenges.

## What This Blog Is About

I primarily use this blog as a place to document and share the projects I'm working on. My posts cover a wide range of topics including:

- **Embedded Systems & Electronics**: Flight controllers, drone development (Icarus project), ESP32 projects, home automation, and custom PCB designs
- **Robotics**: ROS/ROS 2 development, rosserial integration, and autonomous systems
- **Firmware Development**: STM32, Arduino, AVR, and Rust on embedded devices
- **Emulation Projects**: Gameboy emulator development and CHIP-8 systems
- **Graphics Programming**: Procedural generation, OpenGL, deferred shading, and Unity projects
- **3D Printing & Makes**: Custom builds, props, and hobby projects
- **Software Development**: C++, Rust, Python, CMake toolchains, and testing frameworks

Most posts are project updates where I elaborate on problems I solved, interesting solutions I came up with, or new technologies I'm exploring.
