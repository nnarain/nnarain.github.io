Duel Daggers from [Dangerous Ladies](https://dangerousladies.ca/products/sallys-daggers-3d-print-files?_pos=1&_psq=Sall&_ss=e&_v=1.0)

This is probably my favorite build to date!

A few steps to this one but nothing I haven't done before.

After the files were printed I moved to smoothing. Though I'm finding it hard to know when the sanding process it done.

This time I used a chrome paint as the base and layered some colored metallics on that.

Made molds for the gems and casted in epoxy resin
