I mentioned getting a Neptune 3 Pro from Elegoo at some point. Well I also got a Mar 3 Pro resin printer!

I've finally got around trying out some prints. This [Mew model](https://www.printables.com/model/181162-mewpokemon) was one I've wanted to do for a long time but I knew the tail would be pretty sketch on a FDM printer.

The quality of the print was amazing! I was super happy with how it turned out. The layer lines are barely visible without any post processing needed.

This was my first print with the resin printer so I was interested in how "painting ready" the model would be without any post processing (which is the part of the process I hate the most). So I opted to do know sanding or smoothing or anything like that.

There also a few things to learn about resin printer. One is how to clean the prints properly. I have the Elegoo Mercury wash basin and even running it through that you can see below the print still had some resin residue on it (it turns white when you cure the print). I probably should have sanding this, but like I said I just wanted to get to painting.

First I primed the model. I originally wanted to due a metallic pink color but then opted to do something more "realistic" (as far as that goes for a pokemon). I had primed it gloss black before making that decision so I had to put a white base coat on it afterwards. Regardless it actually turned out pretty good.

I also got this little turntable for air brushing which was nice.

Having to painting the eyes was... scary... part of the reason I wanted to do a stylized metallic look. I gave it a shot though. It turned out ok (ha). I used silly putty to mask off parts of the model and paint in the details. It's hard to do it consistently.

Overall I'm pretty happy with this and looking forward to doing more resin printing.
