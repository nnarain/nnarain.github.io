Ghost Mask from "Ghost of Tsushima"

Second resin print. This was almost too big for the resin printer but luckily it managed to fit.

The mask was printed in two pieces and glued together shown above. On the right you can see some deformity from the support material. I wasn't too sure how to fix it to left it as is.

Airbrushed the teeth with metallic gold paint.

Final layer with Metallic Black paint. The metallic colors are shiny so it looks more silver but in real life it leans more black.
