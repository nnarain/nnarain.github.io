**Platform Controller** (College, January - April 2015)

An embedded system designed to communicate with a external host and drive a robot platform.

* [Design]({% post_url 2015-2-28-HCS12 Board Complete! %})
* [Assembly]({% post_url 2015-3-18-Board Assembly!!! %})
* [Bring Up]({% post_url 2015-3-27-Board Bring Up %})
* [Platform Software](https://github.com/nnarain/ESEPlatformController)

During this project I also created the [Platform Supervisor](https://github.com/nnarain/ESEPlatformSupervisor-Desktop), in Qt, to control the platform from a desktop environment as well as an [app](https://github.com/nnarain/ESEPlatformSupervisor-App) version to control the platform from a Android smartphone via Bluetooth.

An object orient wrapper for OpenGL. [SGL Repo](https://github.com/nnarain/sgl-wrapper)

* [SGL Demo]({% post_url 2015-5-3-SGL FPS Counter %})

This is an ongoing project that I am improving as I make more OpenGL applications.
